### **Slide 1: Why You MUST Incorporate AI Into Your Research Workflow**

**(Start of Script)**

"Good morning, everyone. In the next few minutes, we're going to explore a topic that is fundamentally reshaping the world of academic and research: Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, I want to address a crucial question: why is it no longer a matter of 'if' but 'how' you should incorporate AI into your research workflow?

Think of AI as your new, unseen colleague—one that works 24/7, can process information at an incredible speed, and offers insights that can elevate your research to new heights.

Let's start with the most tangible benefit: **accelerating discovery**. Traditionally, a comprehensive literature review could take weeks, even months. With AI-powered tools, you can now synthesize thousands of papers, identify key themes, and pinpoint research gaps in a matter of hours. This isn't just about saving time; it's about getting to the core of your research question faster and more efficiently.

Next, AI can significantly **enhance the methodological rigor** of your work. From helping you design more robust experiments to identifying potential biases in your data, AI can act as a critical friend, ensuring your findings are as sound and reproducible as possible. This is crucial in an era where the credibility and integrity of research are paramount.

But where AI truly becomes a game-changer is in its ability to **unlock new insights**. We often deal with incredibly complex datasets. AI algorithms can sift through this complexity and uncover hidden patterns and correlations that the human eye might miss. This can lead to the generation of novel hypotheses and push the boundaries of knowledge in your field.

Of course, we all know that research involves a significant amount of tedious work. AI can **automate many of these laborious tasks**. Imagine having an assistant that can handle the initial stages of a literature search, clean and organize your data, and even manage your references. By delegating these tasks to AI, you free up your most valuable asset—your intellectual energy—for critical thinking, analysis, and creative problem-solving.

Finally, let's talk about the competitive landscape. The reality is that research is evolving. Your peers, your collaborators, and your competitors are increasingly leveraging AI. To remain at the forefront of your field and to continue producing high-impact research, embracing AI is no longer just an advantage; it's a necessity.

By the end of this lecture, I hope to convince you that incorporating AI into your research workflow isn't about replacing the researcher; it's about augmenting your capabilities and empowering you to do what you do best: push the frontiers of human knowledge.

Thank you."

### **Slide 2: The Symbiotic Researcher: Tangible Benefits of AI in Your Workflow**

**(Start of Script)**

"Now that we've established _why_ you should incorporate AI into your research, let's delve into the specific, tangible benefits. Think of this as a symbiotic relationship, where AI enhances your capabilities as a researcher.

First and foremost, let's talk about **enhanced data analysis**. We are often faced with massive datasets that can be overwhelming to analyze manually. AI algorithms can process this data at a speed and scale that is simply not humanly possible. More than just speed, AI can uncover subtle patterns and correlations within your data that you might have missed, leading to new and exciting avenues of inquiry.

Next, the dreaded **literature review**. We've all been there, spending countless hours sifting through papers. AI can dramatically streamline this process. Imagine a tool that can quickly scan thousands of articles, identify the most relevant ones to your work, and even summarize their key findings. This allows you to quickly get to the core of an article or research paper.

The quality of our writing is paramount. AI offers powerful **writing assistance**. Tools like Grammarly and other AI-powered platforms can provide real-time feedback on your writing, helping with everything from grammar and style to the overall coherence and clarity of your arguments.

Finally, let's not forget the educational aspect. AI provides **personalized learning and support**. For students and even seasoned researchers learning a new methodology, AI tools can act as intelligent tutors, offering tailored learning experiences and helping to grasp complex concepts.

In essence, these benefits allow us to offload the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of research, freeing us up to focus on what truly matters: critical thinking, creativity, and groundbreaking discovery."

### **Slide 3: The Critical Eye: Navigating the Limitations of Large Language Models**

**(Start of Script)**

"As with any powerful tool, it's crucial to understand its limitations. While the benefits of AI are immense, we must approach the use of Large Language Models, or LLMs, with a critical eye.

A significant concern is the phenomenon of **'hallucinations.'** This is when an LLM generates information that appears credible but is, in fact, inaccurate or completely made up. It might confidently state a fabricated "fact" or cite a non-existent source. This underscores the absolute necessity of fact-checking any information provided by an LLM.

Another critical issue is **bias in the training data**. LLMs learn from the vast and often messy world of internet text. This means they can inadvertently absorb and reproduce the biases present in that data. This can manifest in stereotyped or skewed information, which can be particularly problematic in a research context.

It is also vital to remember that LLMs **lack true understanding**. They are incredibly sophisticated at recognizing and replicating patterns in language, but they don't _understand_ concepts in the way humans do. They haven't had life experiences and have no genuine comprehension of the topics they discuss. We must be careful not to mistake their eloquent outputs for true intelligence.

Finally, be aware of **outdated knowledge**. Many LLMs have a knowledge cut-off date, meaning they are not aware of events or research that has emerged since their last training. This can lead to them providing information that is no longer current or relevant.

Understanding these limitations is not meant to discourage the use of AI. Instead, it's about fostering a responsible and informed approach. By being aware of these potential pitfalls, we can leverage the power of AI while upholding the rigorous standards of academic integrity."

### **Slide 4: Ethical Concerns of AI in Academic Research & Writing**

**(Start of Script)**

"Now, let's move to a critical part of our discussion: the ethical considerations of using AI. While AI offers powerful assistance, its use is not without significant ethical challenges that we, as researchers, must navigate carefully.

First, there are profound **threats to academic integrity**. If we rely too heavily on AI to generate our ideas and text, we risk diminishing our own critical thinking and essential research skills. Furthermore, as we've discussed, these models can "hallucinate"—that is, they can create incorrect or nonsensical information, which, if not caught, can undermine the credibility of our work.

This brings us to the complex issues of **plagiarism and authorship**. Major publishers and academic bodies have made it clear: an AI cannot be listed as an author. Authorship implies responsibility and accountability, which a machine cannot hold. Therefore, if you use AI-generated text, you are solely responsible for its originality and accuracy. The line between using AI as a tool and committing plagiarism can be thin, and it's a line we must not cross.

Another serious concern is the **amplification of bias**. AI models learn from the data they are trained on, which is often a reflection of the internet—biases and all. This means AI tools can unintentionally generate content that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or presents a skewed perspective, which is antithetical to the principles of objective research.

Finally, we must be vigilant about **data privacy and confidentiality**. When you input your research questions, unpublished data, or sensitive information into a public AI tool, you may be giving up control over that information. It could be stored, used to train future models, or even become publicly accessible. This is especially critical when dealing with confidential or personal data, where we have a legal and ethical duty to ensure its protection.

Addressing these concerns head-on is the first step toward using AI responsibly in our work."

**(End of Script)**

### **Slide 5: Guidelines for an Ethical Use of AI as a Scholar**

**(Start of Script)**

"Given the ethical concerns we've just discussed, how do we move forward responsibly? Fortunately, a consensus is emerging in the academic community, providing us with clear guidelines. Let's walk through the most important principles.

First and foremost, **take full responsibility**. The core rule is that you, the human researcher, are the author. AI is a tool, much like a calculator or a word processor. You cannot simply copy and paste its output. You must verify every claim, check every source, and ensure the final work is your own, holding yourself accountable for its accuracy and originality.

Second, **be transparent**. Honesty about your methods is a cornerstone of academic integrity. You should disclose which AI tools you've used and how they assisted your research process. This could be in the methods section, a footnote, or the acknowledgments. Transparency builds trust with your readers and reviewers.

Third, **protect your data**. You must be compliant with all data protection laws. This means you should not upload any sensitive or unpublished data—whether it's your own intellectual property or personal data from research participants—into external AI tools unless you have explicit assurances about how that data will be handled.

Fourth, if you're involved in **creating or fine-tuning AI models, be mindful of the data you use**. The principle of 'garbage in, garbage out' applies here. Using biased, outdated, or incorrect information to train a model will only result in a flawed tool that produces unreliable output.

Fifth, always **maintain human oversight**. Recognize that AI is not a replacement for your own knowledge and critical thinking. You are the expert. Use AI to handle repetitive tasks or generate initial ideas, but the final analysis, interpretation, and conclusions must come from your own intellect.

Finally, **stay informed**. AI technology and the guidelines around its use are changing at a breathtaking pace. As scholars, it is our responsibility to keep up with these developments to ensure we are always following the best and most ethical practices.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can harness the power of AI while upholding the integrity and quality of our scholarly work."

**(End of Script)**

### **Slide 6: EU Guidelines for the Use of Generative AI in Research**

**(Start of Script)**

"To further solidify our understanding of ethical AI use, let's look at the formal guidance provided by the European Commission in its 'Living guidelines on the responsible use of generative AI in research.' These recommendations provide a robust framework for the entire European research area.

A foundational principle is that researchers must **remain ultimately responsible** for their scientific output. The guidelines state clearly that you are accountable for the integrity of your work, and they reiterate that AI systems can be neither authors nor co-authors. Authorship requires agency and responsibility, which lies solely with the human researcher.

The EU places a strong emphasis on **transparency**. Researchers are expected to transparently detail which generative AI tools have been used in a substantial way during their research process. This includes not just naming the tool, but also how it was used and how it influenced the results.

Next, the guidelines stress the importance of **paying particular attention to privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property rights**. You must be careful not to upload unpublished work or sensitive data into an external AI system without clear assurances that the data will not be re-used. This is especially critical for third-party personal data, where compliance with EU data protection rules is mandatory.

Recognizing the dynamic nature of this field, the guidelines call on researchers to **continuously learn how to use these tools properly**. This means staying up to date on the best practices and sharing this knowledge with colleagues to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks.

Finally, a crucial directive is to **refrain from using generative AI in sensitive activities**. This explicitly includes tasks like peer review or evaluating grant proposals. Using AI here introduces risks of unfair assessment due to the tool's inherent limitations, and it could expose the confidential, unpublished work of your peers.

These EU guidelines provide a clear and actionable framework, reinforcing that while AI is a powerful new tool, the core principles of research integrity—responsibility, transparency, and respect—remain unchanged."

### **Slide 7: AI Tools for Academic Research and Writing**

**(Start of Script)**

"Now that we've covered the benefits, limitations, and ethical guidelines, let's dive into the practical side of things. In this section, we'll explore some of the specific AI tools that can be integrated into your academic workflow. Please note, this is not an exhaustive list, but rather a curated overview of popular and useful tools across different categories.

First, we have the **General and Academic Chatbots**.

- **ChatGPT** is arguably the most well-known. It's a powerful all-rounder that can assist throughout the entire research process—from brainstorming ideas to summarizing articles and even analyzing data files like PDFs and spreadsheets that you upload directly.
- **Claude 3** is a major competitor that is highly regarded for its strengths in creative and academic writing. Its key advantage is a very large context window, allowing you to work with texts of up to about 150,000 words.
- **Perplexity** functions more like an AI-powered search engine. It's excellent for asking questions and receiving concise answers complete with citations from reputable online sources.
- Moving to more specialized tools, **Scite** is built for researchers. Its standout feature is providing "smart citations" that tell you whether a paper supports or contrasts the claims of another, which is incredibly useful for literature reviews.
- **ChatDOC** is another fantastic tool for working directly with your sources. You can upload papers, and it will extract relevant information while providing precise in-text citations and page numbers, allowing you to easily trace and verify its answers.

Next, let's look at **Literature Discovery and Management**.

- While Google Scholar is a staple, **Semantic Scholar** is an AI-powered search engine that generates concise abstracts for papers, letting you quickly grasp the key points without having to read the entire document.
- **ResearchRabbit** offers a more visual approach, using AI to map the connections between research papers and authors, helping you discover new and relevant literature in a very intuitive way.
- And of course, these new tools work alongside established **reference managers** like Mendeley and EndNote, which remain essential for organizing your library and citations.

For the writing process itself, there are powerful **Academic Writing and Editing** tools.

- **Trinka** is an AI assistant designed specifically for academic and technical writing, so it understands the specific conventions and styles we use.
- **Grammarly** is a more general-purpose tool that many of you probably already use. It's excellent for proofreading, checking your tone, and detecting plagiarism.
- **Quillbot** is another popular option, particularly useful for its paraphrasing and summarizing capabilities.

Finally, in **Data Analysis and Visualization**, AI is making huge strides.

- Tools we use every day, like **Microsoft Excel**, now have AI integrated through Copilot, which can analyze patterns in your data and create plots for you in seconds.
- Similarly, **Tableau** has introduced Tableau Pulse, a generative AI that simplifies data analysis and helps you uncover insights you might not have even thought to look for.

The goal with all these tools is to find the ones that best fit your specific needs and workflow. By using them thoughtfully, you can automate tedious tasks and dedicate more of your time to the critical thinking and creativity at the heart of your research."

### **Slide 8: Practical Demonstration: ChatDOC - Your AI Reading Assistant**

**(Start of Script)**

"Now, I'd like to move from the theoretical to the practical with a demonstration of a specific tool that I find incredibly useful: **ChatDOC**. Think of it as your personal AI reading assistant.

So, what is it? ChatDOC is a research tool built on GPT technology that allows you to upload one or even a collection of up to 30 documents and have a conversation with them. It supports a wide range of file types, including PDFs, Word documents, and even websites. Its purpose is to help you quickly extract, locate, and summarize information so you're not wasting time reading material that isn't relevant to your work.

But its most important feature, and the reason I'm highlighting it, is that **every answer it provides comes with in-text citations and page references.** This is a game-changer for academic integrity. You can instantly trace the information back to the source document to verify its accuracy and context.

Let's look at some core **use cases for researchers**. We've all faced a dense, 40-page paper. With ChatDOC, you can upload it and immediately **get a summary or an abstract**. As you can see in the first example from the tutorial, after uploading a paper, ChatDOC automatically provides an abstract and suggests some relevant questions to get you started.

You can also use it to **find specific information**. Instead of skimming for an hour, you can simply ask, 'What was the methodology used?' and get a direct answer with a citation. As shown in the tutorial images, you can even highlight a specific table or paragraph and ask a targeted question about just that selection, which is the best way to get a precise answer.

One of the most powerful features is its ability to work across multiple documents. You can upload several papers from different authors and ask it to **contrast their views** on a specific topic. This can dramatically speed up your literature review process.

Finally, you can use it to push your own thinking. Ask it to **critically challenge an interpretation** in a paper or to **brainstorm new research angles** based on the document's contents.

To get the most out of ChatDOC, here are a few **tips for effective use**. First, **be specific**. Asking it to 'summarize this entire book' won't work well due to token limits. Instead, focus your questions.

Second, if you want to ask a follow-up question, you must **use the 'thread' feature**. The tool doesn't automatically remember the context of your last question, so clicking 'reply' or starting a thread is essential for a coherent conversation.

And as I mentioned, the best practice is to **highlight the text** you're interested in before asking your question. This focuses the AI's attention and gives you the most relevant and accurate response.

By integrating a tool like ChatDOC thoughtfully, you can see how AI moves from being a simple writing aid to a powerful partner in the research process itself."

### **Slide 9: Extras: Specialized AI Assistants (GPTs) in ChatGPT**

**(Start of Script)**

"Before we conclude, I want to touch on a powerful feature available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers that takes AI assistance to the next level: **GPTs**.

So, **what are they?** Think of GPTs as custom-built, specialized versions of ChatGPT. Users can create them with specific instructions, knowledge, and capabilities for a particular purpose. These are then shared in a 'GPT Store' right within the ChatGPT interface. If the standard ChatGPT is a generalist, a GPT is a specialist.

This is incredibly valuable for us as researchers because many of these GPTs are designed to streamline very specific parts of the academic workflow. Let's look at a few popular examples.

For **literature search and analysis**, there are some fantastic tools.

- Instead of a broad search, you can use a GPT like **Consensus**. You ask it a research question, and it dives into a database of millions of papers to find cited answers.
- **ScholarAI** goes a step further, allowing you to not only search for papers but also to analyze the content _within_ them, including text, figures, and tables.
- And **AskYourPDF Research Assistant** gives you conversational access to a library of over 400 million papers.

When it comes to the **writing and review process**, there are GPTs for that too.

- The **Academic Assistant** is a GPT that has been trained on the specific style and tone of academic writing, helping you polish your manuscript.
- You can also use the **Paper Reviewer** GPT. This tool acts as a first-pass peer reviewer, giving you feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your paper before you send it off to a journal.

And finally, for **data and visualization**, some GPTs are indispensable.

- The **Wolfram** GPT integrates the powerful Wolfram Alpha computational engine, giving ChatGPT advanced capabilities for solving complex math problems and analyzing data.
- If you need to create a visual aid, a GPT like **'Diagrams: Show Me'** can generate a flow chart or a mind map from a simple text description, saving you a significant amount of time.

Exploring the GPT Store can help you find or even build the perfect AI assistant for your specific research needs. It truly allows you to transform a general tool into a personalized, high-powered research partner. As always, the key is to use these tools critically and transparently."

### **Slide 10: Integrating AI - Step 1: Defining Your Research Problem**

**(Start of Script)**

"Now, let's get into the core of today's lecture: a step-by-step guide on how to practically integrate AI into your research workflow, from the initial idea to the final publication. We'll start at the very beginning: **Defining Your Research Problem.**

This initial stage is all about exploration and refinement, and AI excels as a brainstorming partner here. First, you can use it to **identify gaps in the current literature**. Instead of spending weeks manually searching, you can prompt the AI to scan recent publications and highlight unanswered questions. For example, you could ask it: 'Review the academic literature of my area of study of the last five years. What questions did these studies leave open for future research?' This gives you a fantastic starting point.

Second, AI is brilliant for exploring **innovative and interdisciplinary approaches**. Sometimes the most groundbreaking research comes from connecting seemingly unrelated fields. You could prompt it with something like: 'Suggest novel applications of game theory to the analysis of the major political decisions taken by King João V of Portugal.' This pushes you to think outside your traditional boundaries.

Once you have a promising idea, AI can help you **formulate concrete research questions and hypotheses**. You can feed it your topic and ask it to generate five potential research questions or a list of testable hypotheses.

Finally, you can leverage AI as a simulated **domain expert**. By framing your prompt carefully, you can get it to act as an advisor. For instance: 'Could you assist me in creating a research problem that explores the societal implications of the intersection of artificial intelligence and employment patterns in the gig economy?' This helps you refine your thinking and structure your problem statement more effectively. In this crucial first step, AI acts as a catalyst, helping you move from a vague interest to a focused, researchable problem."

**(End of Script)**

---

### **Slide 11: Integrating AI - Step 2: Outlining and Literature Review**

**(Start of Script)**

"Once you've defined your research problem, the next steps are to **create a structure and dive into the literature**. This is where AI can save you an immense amount of time and effort.

First, you can use AI to **develop a complete outline from scratch**. The key here is to assign the AI a role. For example, you can prompt it: 'As my dissertation director, help me organize the structure of my PhD dissertation in environmental science.' By giving it a role, you guide it to provide a more structured and relevant output, including all the key sections from introduction to conclusion.

Next, you can use it to **conduct a structured literature review**. After you've found your sources—and we'll get to that crucial point in a moment—AI is exceptional at synthesis. You can ask it to compare methodologies across papers, summarize key arguments, or identify areas of consensus and contention in the debate on a topic.

You can also use it to consciously **add interdisciplinary perspectives** to your review. A prompt like, 'Explore insights from cultural anthropology to better understand the role of rituals in shaping online communities,' can add a rich, new layer to your work.

However, I need to give you a **critical warning**. This is one of the most important takeaways from this lecture. **Do NOT use a general chatbot like ChatGPT to gather your sources.** These models are prone to 'hallucinations' and can invent very plausible-sounding but completely non-existent articles and authors.

Instead, you should use specialized academic AI tools like Scite, Elicit, or Semantic Scholar to **find** your literature. Once you have downloaded the actual, verified papers, you can then use general AI chatbots like ChatGPT or dedicated tools like ChatDOC to help you **summarize and synthesize** them. This two-step process is essential for maintaining academic integrity."

**(End of Script)**

---

### **Slide 12: Integrating AI - Step 3: Screening, Methodology, & Initial Writing**

**(Start of Script)**

"With your sources gathered, the next phase involves **screening them, defining your methodology, and starting the writing process.**

First, AI can help you **screen your sources efficiently**. You can define a clear set of criteria and instruct the AI to act as a filter. For example, you could say: 'Discard sources that solely cover broader ecological issues without specific attention to amphibian populations.' This ensures you're only working with the most relevant literature.

Next, AI can be a valuable assistant in **developing your methodology**. This is a complex part of any research project, but AI can help you structure it. You can ask it to outline the steps for a randomized controlled trial, including participant recruitment and statistical analysis, or to describe how a mixed-methods approach could provide a more comprehensive understanding of your topic. It can even help you critically assess your own proposed methodology and identify potential biases.

Once your methodology is set, AI can help with the initial writing, starting with **crafting the title and introduction**. You can provide your abstract and ask for five title suggestions that are concise, informative, and attention-grabbing. Similarly, you can ask it to draft an engaging introduction that sets the stage for your research, presents your research question, and explains its significance.

Throughout this process, you'll be using AI for several key tasks. You can ask it to **summarize** articles to a specific word count, **translate** foreign-language sources, and assist in **fact-checking** key dates, figures, and statements. Remember, for fact-checking, the AI is a starting point—always verify critical information against the original, primary sources."

**(End of Script)**

---

### **Slide 13: Integrating AI - Step 4: Data Analysis, Discussion, & Securing Funding**

**(Start of Script)**

"As you move into the later stages of your project, AI continues to be a valuable partner in **analysis, discussion, and even securing funding.**

After you've collected your data, AI can help you **analyze and interpret it**. Whether you're working with quantitative data and need help with species richness calculations, or with qualitative data from interviews, you can use AI to identify recurring themes and patterns. You can prompt it to interpret linguistic patterns in a corpus of texts or discuss the implications of GIS analysis, helping you to see the story within your data.

Next comes the crucial **discussion section**, where you make sense of your results. AI can help you frame this section by exploring how your findings either support or challenge existing theories in your field. It can also help you articulate the broader importance of your outcomes and even propose plausible explanations for any unexpected results.

A key part of the discussion is **proposing avenues for future research**. You can ask the AI to act as an advisor, helping you brainstorm specific, precise questions that your work has opened up and suggesting interdisciplinary collaborations that could enrich future studies.

Finally, let's not forget a very practical step: **searching for and applying for funding**. You can use AI to scan for grant opportunities that align with your research themes. It can also be an invaluable writing partner when you need to craft a captivating project abstract or an engaging research proposal that clearly communicates the promise and potential of your work to funders."

**(End of Script)**

---

### **Slide 14: Integrating AI - Step 5: Finalizing & Disseminating Your Work**

**(Start of Script)**

"Finally, we arrive at the last stage: **finalizing your manuscript and sharing it with the world.**

First, AI can help you **write an effective conclusion**. This is your last chance to leave an impression on the reader. You can prompt the AI to help you summarize your key findings, reflect on their broader societal impact, and powerfully reiterate the significance of your work.

Once the writing is done, the meticulous work of **checking citations and references** begins. AI can be a huge help here. You can ask it to scan your document to ensure all your in-text citations follow a specific style guide and to help you organize your reference list correctly.

Before you submit, you should put your paper through a final round of polishing. You can use AI to **act as a peer reviewer, editor, and proofreader**. For example, you can prompt it: 'Act as a peer reviewer for my political science article and challenge the presented conclusions by discussing other factors.' This critical feedback can significantly strengthen your paper. For detailed grammar and style, specialized tools like Trinka are highly recommended.

Lastly, AI can help you **plan your outreach strategy**. It's not enough to just publish; you want your research to have an impact. You can ask AI for guidance on selecting the most suitable journals for your work, or for help crafting a compelling cover letter. You can even ask it to suggest strategies for transforming your complex findings into easily understandable content for the general public, ensuring your research reaches the widest possible audience.

By integrating AI across all these stages, you are not replacing your expertise, but augmenting it, allowing you to produce higher-quality research more efficiently and effectively."

### **Slide 15: Live Example: A Research Workflow with AI**

**(Start of Script)**

"Alright, we've covered the theory, the tools, and the ethics. Now, let's put it all together in a live example. I'm going to walk you through a realistic research workflow, showing you the exact prompts you can use and, crucially, which tool to use for each step.

Our hypothetical research topic is a timely one: 'The Impact of Remote Work on Urban Planning and Employee Well-being.' It's a broad topic, so our goal is to use AI to help us narrow it down into a focused research question and then build a preliminary outline for a paper.

We'll follow a three-phase workflow. Phase one will be all about brainstorming and defining our problem, and for that, we'll use ChatGPT. Phase two is the critical step of finding and analyzing our sources, where we'll use a proper academic database like Google Scholar and then an analysis tool like ChatDOC or ChatGPT's own file upload feature. Finally, in phase three, we'll return to ChatGPT to synthesize our findings and draft an outline. This structured approach ensures we're using each tool for what it does best."

**(End of Script)**

---

### **Slide 16: Live Example: Phase 1 & 2**

**(Start of Script)**

"Let's begin with Phase 1. We open up ChatGPT with our broad topic. Our goal here is to find a specific angle.

Our first prompt gives the AI a role, which leads to better results. We'll type: 'Act as a research advisor... what are the key research gaps...?' ChatGPT will then scan its knowledge and likely point out several areas, such as impacts on public transit, the digital divide, or, for our example, the dual impact on commercial real estate and employee isolation.

Now we can narrow down. Our second prompt builds on the AI's response: 'Based on the gap related to commercial real estate and social isolation, formulate three potential research questions.' From its suggestions, we can select or refine one to be our guiding question. By the end of this 5-minute conversation, we've gone from a vague idea to a focused, actionable research question.

Now for Phase 2, and I cannot stress this enough: **this is the most important step to do correctly.** We do **not** ask ChatGPT to find sources. Instead, we open a new tab and go to a reliable database like Google Scholar. We use our new keywords—'hybrid work commercial real estate,' 'employee isolation'—to find actual, peer-reviewed articles. We then download the PDFs for two or three of the most relevant-looking papers.

Once we have a real PDF on our computer, we can move to the analysis step. We can use a tool like ChatDOC, or the file upload feature in ChatGPT Plus. We upload one of the PDFs and now we can ask specific questions about _its_ content. A great prompt is: 'Summarize the key findings of this paper... in three bullet points. Provide the page number for each finding.' By asking for page numbers, we are forcing the AI to stick to the source and making it easy for us to verify. We repeat this process for our other downloaded papers."

**(End of Script)**

---

### **Slide 17: Live Example: Phase 3**

**(Start of Script)**

"Finally, we enter Phase 3. We have our research question, and we have verified, citable summaries from real academic papers. Now we can go back to ChatGPT to act as our organizational assistant.

This is where we use a 'mega-prompt' that brings everything together. We start by again assigning a role and stating our research question clearly. Then, we explicitly instruct it to use ONLY the information we provide. We literally copy and paste the bullet-point summaries we generated in Phase 2 directly into the prompt, clearly labeling which paper they came from.

We end the prompt by giving it a clear task: 'Organize these points into a logical flow, creating subheadings for the literature review based on emerging themes.'

What we get back is not a finished paper, but something incredibly valuable: a structured and coherent outline. It will have an introduction that frames the problem and a literature review section with logical subheadings, populated with the key points from the articles we found.

This outline is now the perfect starting point. The AI has done the heavy lifting of organizing the foundational information. Now, our job as researchers begins: to take this scaffold, build upon it, and weave in our own critical analysis, interpretation, and original arguments.

As you can see, this workflow uses AI as a partner at each stage—a brainstormer, an analyst, and an organizer—while ensuring that the core of the research is grounded in verified, legitimate scholarship, with the final critical thinking left entirely up to you."

### **Slide 18: Summary - AI Integration Across the Research Lifecycle**

**(Start of Script)**

"So, to bring everything we've discussed in this section together, let's look at a high-level summary of how AI can be integrated across the entire research lifecycle. It's not just a tool for one specific task; it can be a partner from beginning to end.

We can break the process down into three main phases.

In **Phase 1: Ideation and Planning**, you use AI as a creative and organizational partner. It helps you brainstorm and **define your research problem** by identifying gaps in the current literature, and then it assists you in **drafting a coherent outline** to give your project a solid structure.

In **Phase 2: The Core Research and Writing**, AI becomes your tireless assistant.
