## Slide 8 – Simple Live Example: Literature Summarization with AI. Introduction to the Tool
- **Objective:** Demonstrate how AI can summarize research papers quickly.  
- **Tool Choice:** We'll use **SciSpace (formerly Typeset)** – a web-based tool that uses AI for literature summarization.  
- **Focus:** Show how the tool generates a concise summary of a research paper, saving researchers valuable time.

---

## Slide 9 – Demonstration
- **Action:** Open **SciSpace** (or a similar tool) and input the title or abstract of a research paper.  
- Example Input: *“Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Opportunities and Challenges”*  
- **Outcome:** The tool generates a concise summary, highlighting:  
  - Key research objectives.  
  - Main findings and conclusions.  
  - Any recommendations or implications.

---

## Slide 10 – Explanation
- **How It Works:** This is a basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** task – AI analyzes the text, identifies important information, and condenses it into a readable format.  
- **Why It’s Useful:**  
  - Automates the initial step of reviewing papers, helping researchers identify whether a paper is relevant.  
  - Saves hours that would otherwise be spent reading lengthy papers in full.  
  - Especially helpful in managing large-scale literature reviews.

---

## Slide 11 – Conclusion
- **In Action:** AI tools like SciSpace showcase how technology enhances efficiency, enabling researchers to focus on deeper analysis and critical thinking.
- **Final Thought:** Even simple NLP tools can make a significant difference in the speed and quality of research workflows.

## Slide 12 – Finding Relevant Papers with AI

- **Traditional Keyword-Based Searches:**  
  - Often miss relevant papers due to varying terminology or emerging concepts.  
  - Limited to exact word matches, potentially overlooking key research.

- **AI-Powered Search Engines:**  
  - **Semantic Search:** Understands the meaning and context of your query.  
    - Finds conceptually similar papers, even with different wording.  
    - Example: *Semantic Scholar* uses AI to identify related research, regardless of keyword overlap.  
  - **Recommendation Engines:**  
    - AI learns from search history and interactions to suggest relevant papers.  
    - Tailors recommendations based on your interests and past work.  
  - **Citation Networks:**  
    - Analyzes citation relationships to reveal seminal works and the evolution of research in your area.
